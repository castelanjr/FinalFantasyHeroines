# FinalFantasyHeroines
Android example app testing some cool libraries and patterns:

* Dagger 2 (My main reason to create this project was to learn this one)
* Retrofit (How do you even consume APIs without it????)
* RxJava + RxAndroid (Gotta love some functional programming - and the Retrofit integration)
* ButterKnife (Hate `findViewById()`)
* AutoParcel (Bye Parcelable boilerplate)
* Design Library

The "_API_" is just a JSON files hosted on some random website

##TODO
* MVP (?)
* Write tests
