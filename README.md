# FinalFantasyHeroines
Android example app testing some cool libraries and patterns:

* Dagger 2 (My main reason to create this project was to learn this one)
* Retrofit (How do you even consume APIs without it????)
* RxJava (Gotta love some functional programming - and the Retrofit integration)
* ButterKnife (Hate `findViewById()`, but still not so sure about the binding API)
* AutoParcel (Bye Parcelable boilerplate)
* Design Library (Still a bit buggy, but `CoordinatorLayout` is pretty cool)

The """API""" is just a JSON files hosted on some random website

##TODO
* MVP
* Write tests
* View binding?
